## How to run madgest?

On the terminal, type:

 node index.js

## Expected output

Expect a few lines of parse tree, and finally a
"OK".

At this point the program only parses a static
variable assignment (one line of code) and shows
the corresponding Syntax tree structure.

## You need NodeJS installed

If you do not yet have NodeJS installed, install it:

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

My internal reminder for kicking butt. (Jukka)

- [ ] Read in a single file, parse with 'esprima'
- [ ] Check out what 'lex' does
- [ ] Tabulate some speed results of parsing a JS to syntax tree
